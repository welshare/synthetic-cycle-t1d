## 1. Hypothesis (DiabetesDAO Research Agent)

**HYP-MC-01**

> Women with T1D show a measurable rise in glucose and insulin needs during the luteal phase. Without cycle-aware dosing, this produces periods of hyperglycemia and occasional overnight crashes from over-correction. Cycle-aware recommendations improve stability.

## 2. Research Agent ‚Üí HPMP Query

- **Agent:** DiabetesDAO_ResearchAgent_v1

- **Data requested:**
    - Menstrual cycle phase (LMP ‚Üí phase) [LOINC 8665-2]

## 3. Consent Layer (Patient-Facing)

**Patient card example:**

- Requester: DiabetesDAO Research Agent
- Purpose: Study glucose changes across cycle phases in T1D.
- Data requested: 90 days CGM + cycle + basal + sleep logs.
- Options: ‚úÖ Approve | ‚ùå Decline
- Guarantee: Only aggregated/anonymized results; revocable anytime.

*(In demo, animate k-anonymity counter ticking up until ‚â•15 consented profiles)*

## 4. Matching Process

- **HPMP matches** profiles from two surveys:
    - Flo App (cycle, symptoms, sleep)
    - DiabetesDAO survey (insulin, CGM, delivery method)
- **Overlap set:** 187 matched profiles with valid cycle + CGM + insulin data.

*(Show panel where Flo + DAO survey data merge via LOINC codes ‚Üí unified schema)*

- Flo App integration
    - The **Flo App** has integrated **Welshare Health Profiles** via HPMP.
    - So, when a user logs symptoms or cycle data in Flo, those answers are automatically stored in their **Welshare profile vault** (encrypted, user-controlled).
    - When the **DiabetesDAO agent** sends a query into HPMP, Flo users with Welshare profiles can receive a **consent request** (e.g., *‚ÄúDo you want to share your cycle + symptom data with this T1D study?‚Äù*).
    - If they approve, HPMP can then link:
        - Flo‚Äôs cycle/symptom data (LOINC-coded).
        - DAO‚Äôs insulin/CGM data (also stored under their Welshare profile).
    - 

---

So in your demo storyline:

1. **Flo user ‚Üí Welshare Profile integration**
    - User installs Flo, accepts Welshare integration.
    - Their cycle + symptom data is mirrored into their encrypted Welshare vault.
2. **DAO agent query ‚Üí HPMP**
    - Agent requests: cycle phase + CGM + insulin dose.
    - HPMP checks user vaults for overlap.
3. **Consent request ‚Üí Flo app notification**
    - User sees: ‚ÄúDiabetesDAO agent wants to analyze how the menstrual cycle affects glucose control. Approve to share your data?‚Äù
    - User approves ‚Üí data flows *anonymously* into the aggregated analysis.
4. **HPMP merges matched profiles**
    - Because Flo + DAO surveys both use **Welshare profile standardization (LOINC/FHIR)**, HPMP can match without identity leakage.

## 5. Results (Synthetic Demo Output)

**Comparison: Luteal vs Follicular nights**

- Mean glucose: **+8.1 mg/dL** in luteal
- Nighttime TIR (70‚Äì180 mg/dL): **‚àí6.4 pp**
- Basal insulin dose: **+14%** in luteal
- Glucose variability (CV): **+3.2 pp**
- Symptom co-signal: night sweats +22%, palpitations +11%, dizziness +9%

**Subset of 64 patients who tried cycle-aware adjustments (‚àí10‚Äì20% basal on flagged nights):**

- TIR ‚Üë 7.8 pp
- Mean glucose ‚Üì 7.3 mg/dL
- Hypoglycemia (<70) no increase

*(In demo: visualize with side-by-side charts)*

## 6. Knowledge Graph Update

- New edge: **T1D ‚Üí Luteal phase ‚Üí ‚Üë insulin needs & nocturnal hyperglycemia**
- Mitigation: **Cycle-aware basal adjustment ‚Üí ‚Üë TIR, no ‚Üë hypos**
- Provenance: Flo + DiabetesDAO data, HPMP aggregated validation.
- Confidence score: 0.78

*(Show node-graph animation, adding this edge with a glowing highlight)*

## 7. Impact Layer (Patient + Researcher)

- **Research agent output:**
    
    ‚ÄúValidated cycle-phase‚Äìdependent insulin variability in T1D. Basal adjustment recommended.‚Äù
    
- **Patient-facing tip (synthetic):**
    
    > ‚ÄúWe noticed your cycle phase may affect your glucose. Consider a 10‚Äì20% basal adjustment on luteal nights ‚Äî this helped many women avoid highs without extra lows.‚Äù
